            Thanks for taking the time to look around! I’m currently working as a Junior Software Developer
            for healthcare marketing firm in the <a href="https://www.boston.gov/" target="_blank">Boston</a> area. Also, I am finishing my Master’s degree in Software Development
            from Boston University. I have previously attended a coding bootcamp in 2017 where I learned Full-stack Development using
            web technologies such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Python. Following bootcamp
            I then worked as Web Developer in the Finance sector in Charlotte, NC. </p>

          <p>Overall, I have about 3 years of technical experience
            working in various roles in technology and engineering in Support engineering,
            Web Development, and my current role as Junior Software Developer. Currently I focus on frontend technologies
            like HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. I also take care of our backend database using SQL server as well as any updates
            to our iOS applications. </p>
